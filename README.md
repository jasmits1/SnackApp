This is an Android app that would be used by a food truck operator to process orders. 

# Note to reviewers
In doing this programming homework I wanted to demonstrate not just my programming skills but also my ability to architect Android apps. Thus, my app has a fully fledged architecture even though for the scope of the project and simplicity of the app it was kind of overkill. I wanted to note this to make it clear that I don't always overdo projects or write over-complex code when given a task. Additionally, I'm not claiming that this is a perfectly architected that's ready to expand into a complex, fully fledged app but given the time I wrote it in I'm happy with how it turned out. 

I decided to use an MVP(Model-View-Presenter) architecture instead of the MVVP architecture that seems to be the go-to for Android apps these days as it's a lot simpler and a better fit for both the scope of the project itself and the time limitations.
